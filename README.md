## Setup Finished Project

For the finished version of this project, go to [the last branch](https://github.com/alamorre/nextjs-chat-tutorial/tree/3-chats).

Go to [Chat Engine](https://chatengine.io) and create a account and project.

Find the Private Key `17f2b119-57be-4a08-868b-111f434c0859` and Project ID `27f5209f-f92b-4249-953e-4aa267c076c3` then replace the values with your API keys.

The project has been deleted so those keys won't work anymore.

### `yarn dev`

Install everything with `yarn` then run `yarn dev` to get up and running.
